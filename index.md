# Welcome to *gpaw-tools*
{: .fs-9 }

`gpaw-tools` is a powerful and user-friendly tool for running Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It provides both a simple command-line interface and a graphical user interface (GUI), aiming to make DFT/MD calculations more accessible to individuals and small research groups. It leverages well-established libraries – **ASE**, **ASAP3**, **Elastic**, **KIM-API**, **Phonopy**, and **GPAW** – as its computational backends​. This integration allows users to simulate material properties, optimize structures, investigate chemical reactions, and perform calculations on systems with many atoms. Researchers and students in fields such as materials science, chemistry, and physics can explore the electronic, optical, and phonon properties of materials without requiring extensive programming expertise. The tool can also produce useful visual outputs, such as potential energy surfaces, electronic band structures, and density of states plots, as shown in the examples below​

Key features of `gpaw-tools` include a primary solver script for DFT calculations, a quick force-field optimization module for pre-relaxation, several utility scripts for convergence testing, and a simple GUI for easier use. In practice, this means you can perform common tasks like geometry optimization, equation-of-state calculations, elastic constant calculations, spin-polarized density of states and band structure analysis, phonon spectrum computations, and even basic optical property calculations (RPA/BSE) with relative ease. The graphical interface further lowers the barrier for new users by allowing basic DFT calculations to be set up and run without manual scripting. `gpaw-tools` is an open-source project (MIT licensed) under active development. It is continually improved with new features and enhancements, and feedback from the community is welcome. Whether you prefer using the command-line or a GUI, `gpaw-tools` offers a convenient higher-level interface to powerful simulation engines, aiming to streamline computational workflows for material science research.

`gpaw-tools` have:
1. The main solver script `gpawsolve.py` can run in PW or LCAO mode. It can perform structure optimization, equation of state, and elastic tensor calculations, and use several different XCs (as well as hybrid XCs) for spin-polarized DOS and band structure calculations, electron densities, phonon calculations, and optical properties (RPA and BSE). In addition to calculations, it can draw DOS and band structures, save all data, and present the data in an orderly way.
2. A force-field quick optimization script, `asapsolve.py`, for MD calculations using ASAP3 and OpenKIM potentials. 
3. To choose better cut-off energy, lattice parameter, and k-points, there are 4 scripts called `optimize_cutoff.py`, `optimize_kpoints.py`,`optimize_kptsdensity.py`, and `optimize_latticeparam.py`.
4. A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for `gpawsolve.py` is called `gg.py`.

## News
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2540)** version 25.4.0 released. This version has a rewritten elastic calculation part. Now it can calculate elastic calculations of bulk and 2D structures successfully.
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2521)** version 25.2.1 released. This version is working fine with GPAW 25.1.0. For nearly a year, optical calculations have not been done due to code changes in GPAW. Now, with this release, optical calculations are working as as possible they can. There is no v25.2.0. Version v25.2.1 is a minor correction over it.
* As our lab has had [an institutional website](https://avesis.gazi.edu.tr/arastirma-grubu/lrg/) for the last year, we will close lrgresearch.org and GitHub relations shortly. Therefore, we have moved gpaw-tools and several other repositories of Prof. Lisesivdin to [sblisesivdin.github.io](https://sblisesivdin.github.io). As a result, the legal address of gpaw-tools is now [https://sblisesivdin.github.io/gpaw-tools](https://sblisesivdin.github.io/gpaw-tools). We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused (January 22, 2025).
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2461)** version 24.6.1 released. This is a quick-fix release. Because SPGlib dropped the ASE type Atoms object after version 2.2.0, `gpawsolve.py` started to give an error. ASE will maintain the `get_spacegroup()` function call from now on. With this change, `gpawsolve.py` no longer requires the `spglib` package.
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2460)** version 24.6.0 released. This version only works with newer versions of > ASE 3.23.0 and GPAW 24.6.0 (June 5, 2024).
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-23100)** version 23.10.0 released (October 13, 2023).
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2370)** version 23.7.0 released. It is a version with major changes, and **you need to add a new keyword `Ground_calc` to your old input files**. Please use the input files in the example folder to create new input files. This version has many new features: Phonon calculations, energy consumption measurement, etc. Please refer to [release notes](development/releasenotes.md#version-2370). (July 4, 2023)
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2320)** version 23.2.0 released. It is a version with major changes that is **incompatible with the previous versions**. Please use the input files in the example folder to create new input files (February 1, 2023).
* A new oral presentation about *gpaw-tools* is presented at MSNG2022 (September 22, 2022).
* We had a small department-wide hands-on activity about installing and using ASE, GPAW, and gpaw-tools software at Gazi University's Department of Physics (August 8, 2022). 
* **[gpaw-tools](development/releasenotes.md#version-2270)** version 22.7.0 released (July 12, 2022).
