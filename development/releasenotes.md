# Release notes

### Development version

* n/a

### Version 25.10.0

* The -v and -h arguments of `gpawsolve.py` were not working. Fixed.
* Many corrections done in `gg.py`. It has become outdated for a while. There are many fixes now. They make gg.py run smoothly. Its chronic "stuck while running the simulation" problem is solved now.
* `asapsolve.py` can run with multiple temperatures, multiple frictions, and time steps now.
* "examples/ASAP3-Example" is renewed for the new features.
* A basic Quantum Espresso (QE) to gpaw-tools converter script is added.
* A basic VASP to gpaw-tools converter script is added.
* "examples/Si-qe" example is added for `qeconverter.py` script
* "examples/Si-vasp" example is added for `vaspconverter.py` script
* Phonopy calculations were giving errors. Fixed.

### Version 25.4.0

* A major change in `elasticcalc()`. Now, gpawsolve.py has a working general elastic calculation function!
* `gpawsolve.py` now gives an error message when running without input.

### Version 25.2.1

* We forgot to change the version information in the code. So there is no v.25.2.0 :) Please use the corrected v25.2.1 version. Sorry for any inconvenience.
* `gpaw-tools` is moved to a new repository at [https://github.com/sblisesivdin/gpaw-tools](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/gpaw-tools). All links in the code are corrected.
* Use new notation in BSE calculations.
* RPA is working again.
* BSE calculations are now working without direction. This is a feature downgrade for now.
* Ignore warnings.
* A basic installation script for Ubuntu systems is added. Just run it in the first place.
* Using .fixdensty() in optical calculations.
* Wrong `ang_mom` variable usage in a loop is corrected.

### Version 24.6.1

* Because the SPGlib dropped the ASE type Atoms object after their version 2.2.0, gpawsolve.py gives an error. From now on, the get_spacegroup() function call will be maintained by ASE. Because of this change, gpawsolve.py no more requires `spglib` package.
* CONTRIBUTING.md file is updated.

### Version 24.6.0

* The localisation feature now includes English, Turkish, German, French, Russian, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.
* Some misleading warning messages are fixed.
* ASE's `FrechetCellFilter` is now used instead of `ExpCellFilter`. However, this update does not concern back compatibility. Users must use > ASE 3.23 and >GPAW 24.6 after this. 
* `nbands` value is added to LCAO calculations.
* `Magmom_single_atom` keyword is added.
* A new example, `Graphene-charged,` is added.
* `Total_charge` variable is added to `gpawsolve.py` and `gg.py` and examples.
* A simple language localisation for DOS and Band graphics. `Localisation` keyword is added to all examples
* Save the trajectory of Elastic Calculations separately.
*  `Hydrostatic_pressure` keyword is added. 
* More information about executing the input files has been added to the example files.
* A fix for hybrid calculations. Hybrid calculations will work only for GPAW versions >= 23.10.0
* Calculate spin-dependent charge densities and zeta = (up-down)/(up+down) to CUBE files for both all-electron and pseudo densities.
* The Cr2O example is changed to show new spin-dependent charge density calculations.
* Deprecated argument -r (restart) is removed.
* A base for future projected band structure calculations (not activated now).

### Version 23.10.0

* Better -v (version info) message.
* Implementing `GPAW.fixed_density()` method corrections for elastic, DOS, and band calculations.
* No need for a general benchmark script.
* Correcting log behavior
* Better total and each atom's PDOS handling. They are written in separate files.
* No need to use ciftoase.py anymore
* Fixing `Ground_kpts_density` and `Ground_gpts_density` usage sourced DOS calculation error.

### Version 23.7.0

* Using dtype as default for PW calculations.
* Drawn DOS and Band figures are aligned with respect to Fermi energy level.
* Implementing autoscale in y-direction for DOS graphs.
* Correcting all possible errors due to gpts and kpts density usage.
* Lowering memory consumption in optical calculations.

* Using world.size for nblocks in optical RPA calc.
* Updated some calculation default values in both `gpawsolve.py` and `gg.py`.
* Small corrections are done to EXX-related parts, XYYY formatted band result data output, optical RPA calculation, ...etc...
* Using `DielectricFunction` with frequencies.
* PW-EXX mode is removed. EXX can be used directly under PW.
* Mostly, no need to use `outdir` variable. However, still can be used.
* Phonon calculation feature is added to `gg.py`.
* Phonopy version information can be viewed when using -v argument.
* Energy consumption measurement with -e argument. This feature only works with Intel CPUs after Sandy Bridge generation. Results are given in kWh!
* Restart -r, --restart argument is now depreceted. There is nothing to be restarted. Instead of -r argument, the new keyword `Ground_calc` is introduced.
* Basic phonon dispersion calculation feature with Phonopy! At least it works for bulk Al. It is not very mature so please keep this in mind. (Thanks to Michael Lamparski for his help and MIT licensed code that he shared.)
* Save figures in higher dpi.
* Fix some bugs, add new variable and rearrange some variable in `gg.py`.
* Add Energy_min variable. Energy_min and Energy_max variables are now working on both band and DOS figures.
* Remove unnecessary variables in the input file for the examples/Si-2atoms-optical example.
* Band structure data can be now exported in XYYYY type ASCII file (Thanks to Andrej Kesely). 
* Fixed some unused imports and local variables.
* Small fixes at `gg.py` file.
* Adding `struct_from_file()` function for future usage.
* `gpawsolve.py` is not only a Python script anymore. The structure of the `gpawsolve.py` is rewritten. The calculations are related to a class named `gpawsolve`. Also, there are functions related to all possible calculations in this class as: `structurecalc()`, `groundcalc()`, `elasticcalc()`, `doscalc()`, `bandcalc()`, `densitycalc()` and `opticalcalc()`. The structure is still primitive and code is rely mostly on global variables, however it is a start and it will be easy to use when it finished properly.
* From this release "-o" argument is deprecated. Code, all examples and related BASH script are fixed.

### Version 23.2.0

* DOS calculation part is changed completely. All calculations for DOS, PDOS and RawPDOS are done with RawPDOS.
* New variable is added: `DOS_convergence`.
* The variables used in `asapsolve.py` is also changed. From this version, `asapsolve.py` will use a special Snake_case (first letter of each variable is capitalized) variables for the input file variables usage.Variable that are affected are: *Manualpbc -> Manual_PBC, pbcmanual -> PBC_constraints, PotentialUsed -> OpenKIM_potential, SolveDoubleElementProblem -> Solve_double_element_problem.*
* Correction of the creating output file that writes spacegroup and special points to a wrong folder.
* Making `do_all_examples.sh` script executable.
* Wrong usage of GW calculation type in `gg.py` is corrected.
* All new variable changes are corrected and new variables are added to `gg.py`.
* `simple_benchmark2021.py` is simplified and renamed as `simple_benchmark2023.py`.
* With time, `gpawsolve.py` uses many variables in it and in input files. However, it does not have a proper naming convention for these variables. Also some of the variable names are misleading the user. From this version, `gpawsolve.py` will use a special Snake_case (first letter of each variable is capitalized) variables for the input file variables usage.
