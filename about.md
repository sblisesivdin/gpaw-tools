## About *gpaw-tools*

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** 
**gpaw-tools** has evolved and is now called **[Nanoworks](https://nanoworks.readthedocs.io/)**! The **gpaw-tools** project began as a script that utilized only ASE and GPAW. Over the course of four years, it evolved into a comprehensive suite leveraging multiple libraries, including ASAP3, Phonopy, Elastic, OpenKIM, and now modern Machine Learning Potentials (MACE, CHGNet, SevenNet). **Please use [Nanoworks](https://nanoworks.readthedocs.io/) for your further studies.**

`gpaw-tools` was developed by [Prof. Dr. Sefer Bora Lisesivdin](https://avesis.gazi.edu.tr/bora) and [Prof. Dr. Beyza Sarikavak-Lisesivdin](https://avesis.gazi.edu.tr/beyzas) as a solution for performing GPAW DFT simulations with a workflow similar to standard DFT software, and working with a GUI for students. Before 2020, [their research group](https://avesis.gazi.edu.tr/arastirma-grubu/lrg) relied on a commercial DFT software (QuantumATK, formerly ATK) for studying low-dimensional structures. However, licensing issues at their institution prompted a search for a new simulation tool. They chose to transition to an open-source approach using ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) and GPAW, which offered flexibility through Python integration and a range of modes (plane-wave, real-space grid, and LCAO). Additionally, they incorporated ASAP3 and OpenKIM for interatomic potential-based pre-optimization, closely mirroring the features of their previous workflow.

While ASE and GPAW are powerful, using them directly requires writing Python scripts. The developers recognized that this could be a barrier for students not deeply familiar with programming. The `gpaw-tools` project was started to provide a more user-friendly interface on top of ASE/GPAW. By wrapping common tasks into command-based use and with a GUI, `gpaw-tools` makes it easier for non-expert users to perform advanced materials simulations. The project began in 2020 and is still in its early stages of development. The creators continue to improve and expand `gpaw-tools`, adding capabilities and refining the user experience. They encourage the community to use and extend the software, provide feedback, and contribute to its development at the related [Github repo](https://github.com/sblisesivdin/gpaw-tools).

Thank you for choosing `gpaw-tools` for your DFT and MD research!
